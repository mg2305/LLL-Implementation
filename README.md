# LLL Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a basic C++ implementation of the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász (LLL) lattice basis reduction algorithm.  
It performs exact integer-based reduction using floating-point Gram–Schmidt computations and includes a minimal built-in verifier.  
A testing script is provided to compare results with FPLLL across random lattice instances.
